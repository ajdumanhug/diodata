Legal Threats Against Security Researchers
------------------------------------------

*Taken with permission for continued contribution via F/OSS contribution from [attrition.org](http://attrition.org/errata/legal_threats/).*

It has been clear for years that businesses have dropped ethics in favor of profit. Protecting the bottom line is usually more important than doing the right thing, even if it means providing a better product to their customers. Companies fear negative publicity, especially if said publicity challenges the security of their products. It doesn't matter that just about every company and product ships with numerous vulnerabilities, and adding security is a band-aid solution rather than an integral part of the development life cycle. Rather than work with researchers who are frequently providing what would otherwise be high-dollar specialized consulting for free, some companies opt to go take the muddy road and pursue legal action against the researchers. This action is one of desperation and attempts to silence and stifle legitimate research and free speech. Invariably, this ends up being a huge negative PR move, much worse than what would occur with the publication of said research without the legal murk.

Companies: Embrace researchers who are trying to improve the security of your products. Work with them, fix vulnerabilities, and coordinate disclosure. This will go a lot farther toward building customer confidence and help avoid negative publicity.

Researchers: Help protect yourself from legal issues. Visit the [EFF's Coders' Rights Projec](https://www.eff.org/issues/coders). Work with companies and respect their timelines for implementing fixes.

**Confirmed threats**

| **When** | **Entity making threat** | **Researchers** | **Research Topic** | **Resolution/Status** | 
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2020-09-10 | [Giggle](https://joinagiggle.com/) | [Digital Interuption](https://www.digitalinterruption.com/) | Giggle App | After attempting to contact the CEO and several Giggle staff to disclosure the vulnerability directly to them, Digital Interuption was blocked each time, and threatened by Giggle users/fans after the CEO insulted them publicly. After disclosing the vulnerability, Giggle threatened the researchers with an unspecified legal threat. |
| 2016-11-17 | [Chase Bank](https://www.chase.com/) | [Chad Scira](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chadscira/) | Web Site Security | Before Chase created a coordinated disclosure policy or bug bounty program, Scira found a vulnerability that allowed creating unlimited reward points. Scira documented and shared with Chase via Twitter. They organized a call with an SVP and engineer where he showed them everything that "went well". After, Chase terminated his credit card of five years as well as terminating a family member's card. Scira disclosed this on 2020-11-04. |
| 2016-12-07 | [PwC](https://www.pwc.com/) | [ESNC GmbH](https://www.esnc.de/) | PwC ACE Software | ESNC attempted to coordinate disclosure of vulnerabilities in PwC software. During the process, PwC sent two Cease & Desist orders trying to silence research. ESNC ignored them and [disclosed the vulnerabilities](http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2016/Dec/6) along with a timeline.

| 2016-06-18 | [Nerium International](https://www.shopnerium.com/) | [Steven Jensen](http://s3jensen.blogspot.com/) | Vulnerability in customer portal | Steven Jensen found a simple enumeration vulnerability in the Nerium customer portal that allows any customer to see any other customer's details, including credit card, address, and more. Nerium ignored his attempts to report it and only contacted him after he posted enough details to show it was a real issue. That contact came in the form of a cease and desist letter. Jensen removed the post, and replaced it with a [timeline of the incident](http://s3jensen.blogspot.com/2016/06/nerium-vulnerability-disclosure.html). |
| 2015-12-23 | Infoba | Henrik Høyer | Vulnerability in Infoba solutions | Høyer found vulnerabilities in his son's kindergarten's computer systems, created by Infoba. He was accused of accessing sensitive information of other students, a claim which he denies. Rather than fix the vulnerabilities, charges were filed against him.

On August 6, 2015, FireEye sent a cease-and-desist letter to ERNW, and followed up via the District Court of Hamburg, who issued an injunction preventing Wilhelm from disclosing some, but not all, of the details of his research. As of Sep 10, 2015, Wilhelm's presentation and slides still contain redacted information. [FireEye's own advisory](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/support/pdfs/fireeye-ernw-vulnerability.pdf) for the issues does not contain vulnerable versions, use CVE identifiers, include CVSS scoring, and has the advisory timeline section not filled out.

| 2015-07-07 | [Magic Software Argentina](http://www.msa.com.ar/) | Joaquín Sorianello | Vulnerabilities in MSA Vot.ar Electronic Voting System | In what appears to be a convoluted story, the protected Twitter account [@FraudeVotar](https://twitter.com/FraudeVotar) published information regarding MSA Vot.ar systems and a vulnerability related to SSL certificates. Joaquín Sorianello saw the information and reported it to MSA as a warning about the issue, but had nothing to do with the account or finding the issue. Weeks later, a group of researchers that does not include Sorianello, [published a paper about a different vulnerability in the Vot.ar system](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aH6kvoLR8O1qWOpEz89FAB2xFcBNB-QqHgZpXxg0vGE/preview?sle=true). After this paper was published, Argentinian metro police conducted a raid of Sorianello's residence per judge's order, despite him not finding or publishing either vulnerability. The story of Sorianello was [published by Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.co.uk/tech-policy/2015/07/police-raid-programmer-who-reported-flaw-in-argentinian-e-voting-system/) and [further summarized and commented on by TechDirt](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150707/06204631571/argentina-rewards-programmer-who-exposed-e-voting-vulnerabilities-with-complimentary-home-police-raid.shtml).

Mike Davis posted the legal threat and says "they're working on it.. lawyers being lawyers.. hopefully at some point we can talk about the technical issues, it was a fun random project..". A day after the legal threat was made public, IOActive [published the research on CyberLock CyberKey](http://www.ioactive.com/pdfs/IOActive_Advisory_CyberLock.pdf).

According to Lim, founder of Syscan, this was due to some form of pressure from Blue Coat who asked him to pass it on to Rigo. Blue Coat has not responded to requests about the nature of the pressure and if it involved a legal threat. A of 2015-03-27, Rigo's research is not public, and his employer says they are working with Blue Coat to "jointly share the findings" in the future. |

Notes about this page:

-   Companies that broadly use the [DMCA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act) may not be included. This page focuses on companies that specifically use legal threats to stifle **security** research.
-   Many companies may use financial threats to stifle research, threatening to pull funding, support contracts or influence customers. There is an arguably fine line between legal threats (costly) and financial threats (also costly). These may be included if they can be properly documented.
-   Companies that fire off Cease & Desist (C&D) letters but do not follow-up will be included here if applicable.

The following incidents are either **not confirmed** as legal or financial threats, or are confirmed and still cross the line to some degree. They are being included here in the hopes that someone will come forward with additional information or clarification.

| **When** | **Company making threat** | **Researchers** | **Research Topic** | **Resolution/Status** |

| 2013-04-30 | [Wowza Media Systems](http://www.wowza.com/) | Michal J. | [Vulnerabilities in the media server's authentication](http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2013/Apr/186) | The vulnerabilities were reported to the vendor who threatened to "reevaluate" the researcher's independent consultant status as well as other indirect threats. The vulnerabilities were disclosed after the vendor refused to provide a remediation plan. The researcher has [terminated their participatin in the vendor's consultant program](http://wejn.com/wowza/). |
| 2008-10-24 | Google | Charlie Miller | Vulns in T-Mobile Google Phone | Researcher Charlie Miller discovered [vulnerabilities in a Google-based phone sold by T-Mobile](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/25/technology/internet/25phone.html), who notified Google who downplayed the issue. Years later, Miller disclosed that Google [went after him via his employer](https://twitter.com/0xcharlie/status/581433111944175616). When asked for details, he [clarified that it was not a legal threat](https://twitter.com/0xcharlie/status/581483558608326656), but a lecture on "responsible disclosure" to his boss at the time. |

The following incidents are related to the ones above, but "cross the line". They include incidents where it was not "security research", but rather activity that was considered a crime by current laws (at the time). Instead of following a more ethical approach or going the route of responsible disclosure, the researcher chose to research and disclose the details in a manner that was questionable. While the threat of law suit of such activity is frivilous to most, the companies are being prudent because the researcher in question likely did break laws in the process.

Over the years, many talks have been cancelled for various reasons. Sometimes, the rumor of legal threats dominate the venue and/or news, but never happened. This table will list such events, to help clarify what happened. As time allows, any case of a security talk being cancelled will be added.

| **When** | **Company making request or threat** | **Researchers** | **Research Topic** | **Resolution/Status** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2012-10-19 | Hewlett-Packard | Kurt Grutzmacher | Huawei / H3C router vulnerabilities | Grutzmacher coordinated disclosure via US-CERT in August. Days before Toorcon 2012, HP sent a polite request for him to cancel, saying patches were not ready. Grutzmacher cancelled his talk. Two days later, HP released the patch, casting doubt over their intention behind the request. |
| 2012-10-10 | (none) | Pirate Bay founders Peter Sunde and Fredrik Neij | Talk titled "Data is Political" | Neij's lawyer advised his client not to travel to a highly visible public conference centered on hacking. Sunde was reportedly too ill to travel. |
| 2012-07-29 | (unknown) | Sergey Gordeychik / Denis Baranov, Positive Technologies | SCADA vulnerabilities including Siemens | The talk "SCADA Strangelove: How I Learned To Start Worrying And Love The Nuclear Plants" was cancelled a week before the conference and replaced with a different SCADA talk by another person not affiliated with Positive Technologies. No confirmation as to why, speculation is the talk was pulled due to vendor pressure. |
| 2012-01-31 | Smart Grid Meter Vendor (unnamed) | Don Weber / InGuardians | Smart Grid Vulnerabilities | Was asked to pull talk from ShmooCon 2012, complied. Presented later at BSidesLV 2012. |
| 2011-08-16 | (none) | Riley Hassel / Shane Macaulay | Google Android Vulnerabilities | BlackHat Briefings Las Vegas 2011 Hassel/Macaulay scheduled to give "Hacking Android for Profit" talk at BlackHat Briefings Las Vegas 2011. Neither presenter showed for their talk. Subsequent articles point out that Google said "The identified bugs are not present in Android", and that the presenters backed out in "fear criminals would use it attack Android phones". In another work, Hassel said "that some of their work may have replicated previously published research, and they wanted to make sure they properly acknowledged that work." |
| 2011-05-18 | Siemens / Department of Homeland Security (DHS) | Dillon Beresford / NSS Labs | SCADA vulnerabilities | TakeDownCon 2011 talk titled "Chain Reactions - Hacking SCADA" was cancelled by Beresford after concerns from Siemens/DHS were expressed. Beresford said "DHS in no way tried to censor the presentation." |
| 2010-07-15 | Taiwanese / Chinese agencies (unnamed) | Wayne Huang, Armorize CTO | Analysis of China's government-backed hacking initiatives | Talk pulled from BlackHat Briefings 2010 in Las Vegas, announced by Caleb Sima, Armorize CEO on Twitter. An earlier version of the talk was given to a small conference in Taiwain in 2007. |
| 2010-06-29 | ATM Vendors (unnamed) | Raoul Chiesa | ATM Vulnerabilities | [Initial](http://www.net-security.org/secworld.php?id=9529) [reports](http://news.softpedia.com/news/Security-Expert-Pulls-Presentation-After-Legal-Threats-146223.shtml) said that Chiesa was threatened by ATM vendors and forced to cancel last minute. [according to Chiesa](http://news.softpedia.com/news/Researcher-Dispels-Rumors-Surrounding-HITB-Europe-Talk-Cancellation-148181.shtml), no threats were made. The talk was cancelled for "logistical issues that day". Some in the industry have classified this as a publicity stunt, to garner more attention for the talk at a subsequent date. |
| 2009-06-30 | ATM Vendors (unnamed, presumed Triton) | Barnaby Jack / Juniper Networks | ATM Vulnerabilities | BlackHat Briefings Las Vegas 2009 talk cancelled by Juniper after ATM vendor expressed concerns about disclosure before customers were fully protected. Information published at BlackHat 2010. |
| 2008-07-02 | Apple | Unamed 'Apple Insiders' | Apple Security Response Team | According to Trey Ford, BlackHat general manager, a panel of Apple insiders were to have a panel to discuss "the company's security-response team". When Apple's marketing department heard, the panel was abruptly cancelled.|
